Matthew Brett - the web pages
#############################

These are my personal web pages, but, as befits my age, they are mostly about
work.

As of July 2017, I am a lecturer at `Birmingham University`_ `College of Life
and Environmental Sciences`_.  My job is to review data analysis and
statistics teaching in the life sciences, and to develop new undergraduate
classes with a stronger emphasis on data exploration and computing.  I hope to
find ways of teaching the next generation of researchers to be more flexible,
accurate and effective in analyzing the kinds of data generated by modern
research.

This is `the textbook for my first full course on data science
<https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2019>`_.  It took much inspiration, and
many pages, from the `Berkeley course on Foundations of Data Science
<https://www.inferentialthinking.com>`_.

I am interested in the phenomenon of Data Science, and I have strong views on
`what it is
<https://matthew-brett.github.io/dsfe/chapters/01/what-is-data-science>`_, and
what we should teach.

Before starting in Birmingham, I was working at the Berkeley Brain Imaging
Center (BIC_).

My own research interests are:

* the :ref:`functional imaging of movement <pubs-movement>`.
* :ref:`functional imaging methodology <pubs-methodology>`.

I have also written |--| and continue to write |--| open source software. Until
2005, my main language was Matlab, but since then I have used Python_ almost
exclusively.  See `Matlab vs Python for teaching
<http://asterisk.dynevor.org/python-matlab.html>`_ for a discussion of why
I made this change, and recommend it strongly to y'all. Since 2005 I have been
working on Python software for analyzing functional and diffusion imaging data;
see the `nipy community`_ project.  I personally work a lot on nibabel_ as well
as the `nipy package`_ and dipy_.

Nearly all the code I work on is at `matthew-brett github`_.

Like many other people, I have been exploring ways of explaining technical
ideas using code and formulae, using, among other things, the `Jupyter
notebook`_.  See `my tutorials`_ for a list of my tutorials on various topics
including mathematics, statistics, brain imaging and computing.  I have
more tutorials about coding at my Pydagogue_ page.  The coding tutorial I like
the most is an introduction to concepts of the Git_ version control system,
called `curious git`_.

I worry about the current state of brain imaging research, and I wrote a
:doc:`manifesto <manifesto>` about teaching as a means to higher quality in
science.

I confess that I sometimes blog at http://asterisk.dynevor.org.

You will find a list of my publications :ref:`here <publications>`. Please let
me know if I've missed something off or you need a copy of one of my papers.

No doubt you want to know what I look like and how to find me - good news -
see :ref:`about-me`.

Maybe you want to know how I built these pages - :ref:`about-site`.
