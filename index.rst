 Matthew Brett - the web pages
==============================

These are my personal web pages.

I work at the Berkeley brain imaging center (bic_).

I used to work on functional imaging of movement.

Later I worked on some aspects of functional imaging methodology.

At the moment I am helping to write new software in Python_ for analyzing
functional imaging and diffusion imaging data.  This is the nipy_ project.  I
personally work a lot on nibabel_ as well as nipy_ and dipy_.
