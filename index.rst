Matthew Brett - the web pages
#############################

These are my personal web pages, but, perhaps sadly, they are mostly about my
work.

As of July 2017, I am a lecturer at `Birmingham University`_ `College of Life
and Environmental Sciences`_.  The University kindly hired me to review data
analysis and stastics teaching in the life sciences, and to develop new
undergraduate classes with a stronger emphasis on data exploration and
computing.

As my job description might suggest, my current main interest is in finding
ways to teach the next generation of researchers to be more flexible, accurate
and effective in analyzing the kinds of data generated by modern research.

Before starting in Birmingham, I was working at the Berkeley brain imaging
center (BIC_).

My own research interests are:

* the :ref:`functional imaging of movement <pubs-movement>`.
* :ref:`functional imaging methodology <pubs-methodology>`.

I have also written |--| and continue to write |--| open source software.  I
used to write most of my software in MATLAB, but now I use Python_ almost
exclusively.  For the last 12 years or so, I have been working on Python
software for analyzing functional and diffusion imaging data.  This is the
`nipy community`_ project.  I personally work a lot on nibabel_ as well as the
`nipy package`_ and dipy_.

Most of the code I work on is at `matthew-brett github`_.

Like many other people, I have been exploring ways of explaining technical
ideas using code and formulae, using, amonng other things, the `Jupyter
notebook`_.  See `my tutorials`_ for a list of my tutorials on various topics
including mathematics, statistics, brain imaging and computing.  I have
more tutorials about coding at my Pydagogue_ page.  The coding tutorial I like
the most is an introduction to concepts of the Git_ version control system,
called `curious git`_.

I worry about the current state of brain imaging research, and I wrote a
:doc:`manifesto <manifesto>` about teaching as a means to higher quality in
science.

I try to keep my list of :ref:`publications <publications>` up to date.
Please let me know if I've missed something off or you need a copy of one of
the listed papers.

No doubt you want to know what I look like and how to find me - good news -
see :ref:`about-me`.

Maybe you want to know how I built these pages - :ref:`about-site`.
