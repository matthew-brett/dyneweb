 Matthew Brett - the web pages
==============================

These are my personal web pages.

I work at the Berkeley brain imaging center (BIC_).

I used to work on functional imaging of movement.

Later I worked on some aspects of functional imaging methodology.

At the moment I am helping to write new software in Python_ for analyzing
functional and diffusion imaging data.  This is the `nipy community`_
project.  I personally work a lot on nibabel_ as well as the `nipy package`_ and
dipy_.

I try to keep my list of :ref:`publications` up to date.  Please let me know if
I've missed something off or you need a copy of one of the listed papers.

No doubt you want to know what I look like and how to find me - good news - see
:ref:`personal`.
