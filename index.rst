 Matthew Brett - the web pages
==============================

These are my personal web pages.

I work at the Berkeley brain imaging center (BIC_).

I used to work on :ref:`functional imaging of movement <pubs-movement>`.

Later I worked on some aspects of functional imaging :ref:`methodology
<pubs-methodology>`.

At the moment I am helping to write new software in Python_ for analyzing
functional and diffusion imaging data.  This is the `nipy community`_
project.  I personally work a lot on nibabel_ as well as the `nipy package`_ and
dipy_.

I sometimes write about the nipy experience in the `nipy blog`_.

Like many other people, I am starting to explore ways of explaining technical
ideas using code and formulae in the `IPython notebook`_.  My most complete
explanation so far is `exploring formulae in R
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/fperez/nipy-notebooks/master/exploring_r_formula.ipynb>`_.

Most of the code I work on is at `matthew-brett github`_.

I wrote some tutorials on imaging and statistics hosted at `Perrin academy`_.  I
have more tutorials about coding at pydagogue_.  My personal favorite is an
introduction to git_ concepts called `git foundations`_

I try to keep my list of :ref:`publications <publications>` up to date.  Please
let me know if I've missed something off or you need a copy of one of the listed
papers.

No doubt you want to know what I look like and how to find me - good news - see
:ref:`about-me`.

Maybe you want to know how I built these pages - :ref:`about-site`.
