Matthew Brett - the web pages
#############################

These are my personal web pages, but, as befits my age, they are mostly about
work.

At the moment I am exploring various projects and working on others that have
been waiting for me to have time.  Before that, I was a associate professor in
data science at the `London Interdisciplinary School`_.

By "data science", I don't mean the traditional formulation of `"big data and
machine learning"
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734>`_, but the
wider conception of data science as a `new model of data analysis in the age of
ubiquitous computing
<https://odsti.github.io/cfd-textbook/intro/what-is-data-science.html>`_.  This is
not data science as an advanced topic in computer science, but data science as
the foundation of data analysis.  It replaces standard teaching of
introductory statistics, but has a stronger emphasis on data exploration and
computing.  We want to teach the next generation of researchers to be more
flexible, accurate and effective in analyzing the kinds of data generated by
modern research.

This is `the current textbook for my courses on data science
<https://odsti.github.io/cfd-textbook>`_.  It took much inspiration, and some
pages, from the `Berkeley course on Foundations of Data Science
<https://www.inferentialthinking.com>`_.

Before starting at the London Interdisciplinary School, I taught data science
at Birmingham University, and before that, I was working at the Berkeley Brain
Imaging Center (BIC_).

My own research interests are:

* the :ref:`functional imaging of movement <pubs-movement>`.
* :ref:`functional imaging methodology <pubs-methodology>`.

I have also written |--| and continue to write |--| open source software. Until
2005, my main language was Matlab, but since then I have used Python_ almost
exclusively.  See `Matlab vs Python for teaching
<http://asterisk.dynevor.org/python-matlab.html>`_ for a discussion of why
I made this change, and recommend it strongly to y'all. Since 2005 I have been
working on Python software for analyzing functional and diffusion imaging data;
see the `nipy community`_ project.  I personally work a lot on nibabel_ as well
as the `nipy package`_ and dipy_.

Nearly all the code I work on is at `matthew-brett github`_.

Like many other people, I have been using the `Jupyter
notebook`_ and other tools to explore ways of explaining technical
ideas using code and formulae.  See `my tutorials`_ for a list of my tutorials
on various topics including mathematics, statistics, brain imaging and
computing.  I have more tutorials about coding at my Pydagogue_ page.  The
coding tutorial I like the most is an introduction to concepts of the Git_
version control system, called `curious git`_.

I worry about the current state of brain imaging research, and I wrote a
:doc:`manifesto <manifesto>` about teaching as a means to higher quality in
science.

I confess that I sometimes blog at http://asterisk.dynevor.org.

You will find a list of my publications :ref:`here <publications>`. Please let
me know if I've missed something off or you need a copy of one of my papers.

No doubt you want to know what I look like and how to find me - good news -
see :ref:`about-me`.

Maybe you want to know how I built these pages - :ref:`about-site`.
