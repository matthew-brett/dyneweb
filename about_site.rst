About this site
+++++++++++++++

I built this site using plain old Sphinx_, with some very small customizations.
I got the idea from `Fernando's site`_, and I have used some of his pages. Thanks
Fernando, as ever, for putting up your stuff for us to share.

You can see the full source of this site from the `site source`_ on
Bitbucket_.

The site logo is from a card that my friend Tim Clark gave me, many years ago.
It turns out to be a reproduction of "Denker" by `Michael Sowa`_. You can buy
`posters of works by Michael Sowa
<http://www.allposters.com/-st/Michael-Sowa-Posters_c28399_.htm>`_ online.
