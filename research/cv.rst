Research Program
****************

I work on developing, implementing and teaching methods of functional data
analysis including FMRI and diffusion weighted imaging.  have a strong interest
in open-source software development as the basis of methods research and
understanding.  My primary focus is the development of a large international
collaboration for new imaging software development (neuroimaging.scipy.org).
Particular scientific interests include technical and theoretical problems in
spatial normalization (inter-subject registration), region of interest analysis,
and new methods of statistical analysis across subjects and tasks.
