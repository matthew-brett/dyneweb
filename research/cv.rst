Research and teaching
*********************

There are five threads to my work:

#. Training in neurology to registrar level;
#. Research on brain basis of movement planning and performance;
#. Research, teaching and consulting on brain imaging methods;
#. Development of open-source software for brain imaging;
#. Teaching statistical and scientific computing.

Training in neurology
=====================

I trained in neurology at: Cambridge; St Bartholomew's hospital; The National
Hospital for Neurology; Oxford and the Hammersmith Hospital.

Research on movement
====================

From 1996-99 I studied PET imaging of apraxia and movement selection
supervised by David Brooks and John Stein. From 1999-2003 I worked on movement
selection with John Duncan at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit.  I
supervised two graduate students on movement neuroscience PhDs (see below).
Between 2003 |--| 2005 I worked on motor neuroscience with Rich Ivry in
Berkeley.

Research and teaching on imaging methods
========================================

As part of my PET research I studied the principles of imaging methods and
began to teach in my own lab and as an invited speaker, resulting in a set of
popular tutorials on imaging statistics and multiple comparison correction
(see *online tutorials* in publication list). The tutorial on multiple
comparisons became a book chapter in a standard reference on functional
imaging analysis (Brett |et al| 2007).

My understanding of methods led me to imaging methods research. I co-wrote a
paper on methods of warping damaged brains to standard brain templates (Brett
|et al| 2001) (480 citations).  In 2001 I gave my first full neuroimaging
course, giving nine hours of lectures and 5 hours of practical teaching. With
Ingrid Johnsrude and Adrian Owen, I wrote a review on ways of identifying
location of brain activation, cited 857 times. Later I published a paper with
Tom Nichols, Jesper Anderson and others on an incorrect statistical procedure
for so-called "conjunction analysis" in the standard functional imaging
software (Nichols |et al| 2005) (1008 citations). I am one of six authors of the
standard reference paper on reporting guidelines for functional MRI (Poldrack
|et al| 2008). I co-authored a paper with Rebecca Saxe and Nancy Kanwisher on
the region of interest technique for analysing FMRI data (Saxe |et al| 2006).

With Eleftherios Garyfallidis and Ian Nimmo-Smith, I became interested in
diffusion imaging (Garyfallidis |et al| 2010, 2012). Our collaboration became
the dipy project, which has continued to develop into a successful
international collaboration of diffusion researchers (Garyfallidis |et al|
2014).

With Jean-Baptiste Poline, I wrote a review and tutorial paper on the general
linear model in functional MRI for a recent special issue of NeuroImage (Poline
and Brett 2012).

Development and teaching on open-source scientific computing
============================================================

My teaching and research in neuroscience and imaging taught me that the code
we use plays a large role in our ability to think about the analysis and ask
new questions of the data.  My teaching showed me that bad teaching and
closed-source or poorly-written scientific software can have a dramatic effect
on the quality of research.

With colleagues in France, I wrote the MarsBaR region of interest toolbox for
region-of-interest analyses in brain imaging.  The toolbox continues to be in
wide general use, and the abstract for MarsBaR has been cited more than 1750
times.

I worked on wavelet analysis methods with Federico Turkheimer and John Aston.
This work introduced me to David Donoho's work on reproducible science
[#donoho]_.  We used our own Phiwave toolbox for an analysis for a competition
at the Human Brain Mapping Conference (Aston, Turkheimer and Brett, 2006).  I
published all the scripts for the analysis to make it reproducible
[#fiac-analysis]_.  I believe this is the first publication of a reproducible
paper in neuroimaging.

While on a two-year visit to Berkeley from 2003 I started working with
programmers and scientists interested in open-source software in scientific
computing.  With Jarrod Millman, I initiated a proposal to develop an
international collaboration with statisticians, signal- and image-processing
experts to write a new open software library for functional imaging analysis.
The NIH funded this proposal as a 3-year R01 grant from 2007-2010.  The
program became the Nipy project |--| http://nipy.org.

The collaborations from this work exposed me to the current best practice for
scientific code and sharing analyses. For example, all our `nipy.org`-based
projects use open-source best practice for software development, including
distributed version control based at http://github.com/nipy, full web-based
code review, and automated code testing.

The Nipy community now consists of six projects. I am the lead developer of the
main *nipy* project and the *nibabel* image reading library, and a core
developer of *dipy* (see above).

My experience in teaching and scientific computing showed me that we
scientists were likely to be making a very large number of errors for both
technical and social reasons.  I have become increasingly involved in projects
to teach computing methods to students and researchers. I have taught and
assisted at *Software Carpentry* workshops [#swc]_ teaching basic techniques
for using scientific code.  With Jean-Baptiste Poline, Stéfan van der Walt and
Paul Ivanov, we have developed a new course on the principles of neuroimaging
that combines teaching of the mathematical ideas with code implementing and
illustrating these concepts.
