Open-source software engineering
================================

Neuroimaging in Python projects
-------------------------------

My main software work since 2005 has been setting up and maintaining a
international collaboration to make fully open tools for neuroimaging data
analysis in Python (http://nipy.org).

Main author and maintainer of `nibabel` image input / output library
(http://nipy.org/nibabel) (Python). Library for reading and writing
medical image formats, including limited support for DICOM image format.  Recorded by Ohloh
web analysis as >91K lines of code, and equivalent cost of $1.3M
(https://www.ohloh.net/p/nibabel).

Lead developer and maintainer of `nipy` functional imaging library
(http://nipy.org/nipy) (Python and C extensions).

Significant contributor to the `dipy` library for analysis of diffusion imaging
(http://nipy.org/dipy) (Python).

All our `nipy.org`-based projects use standard open-source best practice for
software development [#]_, including distributed version control based at
http://github.com, full web-based code review, automated unit tests, automated
remote testing of all code commits using our own continuous integration server
and publicly available testing servers for open-source projects.

Other scientific software projects
----------------------------------

Contributor to the `SPM` software package (http://fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). `SPM`
is the most widely-used software for the analysis of functional brain images
such as those from functional MRI.  It is mostly written in MATLAB with some C
mex extensions.

Main author and maintainer of MarsBaR region of interest analysis toolbox
(http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) (MATLAB).  MarsBaR is a toolbox based on SPM
and also written in MATLAB. Our abstract listed as the citation for MarsBaR has
been cited over 1000 times (Brett *et al* 2002).

Main author of Phiwave wavelet toolbox for SPM (http://phiwave.sourceforge.net)
(MATLAB and C-mex extensions).  Phiwave implements the ideas described in Aston
*et al* (2006) and Turkheimer *et al* (2000).

Contributor to `scipy` scientific algorithms library for Python
(http://scipy.org); `numpy` array library for Python, `statsmodels` statistical
library for Python, as well as `cython` C-optimization library, `sympy` library
for symbolic mathematics.

  system : (http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/foundation.html
* floating point representation :
  http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/floating_point.html

  registration between subjects; modeling of evoked haemodynamic signal;
  analysis of variance and multiple regression using the General Linear Model;
