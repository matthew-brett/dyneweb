Open-source software engineering
================================

Contributor to `SPM` software (http://fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). `SPM` is the most
widely-used software for the analysis of functional brain images such as those
from functional MRI. It is mostly written in MATLAB with some C mex extensions.

Main author and maintainer of MarsBaR region of interest analysis toolbox
(http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) (MATLAB).  MarsBaR is a toolbox based on SPM

* floating point representation :
  http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/floating_point.html
* floating point error: http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/floating_error.html

Imaging methods
---------------

Author of several widely-read imaging tutorial pages for neuroscientists,
including:

* The relationship of basic analysis of variance and regression to linear
  algebra: http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/PrinciplesStatistics
* 3D convolution: http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/PrinciplesSmoothing
* Random field theory for statistical inference with multiple comparisons:
  http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/PrinciplesRandomFields,
  http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/SmallVolumeCorrection.  These last
  two pages became the basis for a chapter on random field theory in a standard
  text on functional MRI analysis (Brett et al 2007).

Sheffield, Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Berkeley, Stanford,
including:

* 2000 – 2003: Invited speaker at annual functional imaging courses held in Paris.

Teaching of functional imaging methods include:

* 2008 – : Regular post-graduate teaching on the course on imaging organized by
  Mark D'Esposito, and Neuroscience Seminar Series organized by Sonia Bishop. I
  teach the principles of functional image analysis including within subject and
  cross subject coregistration, diagnostics, statistical testing statistical
  inference. I also teach basic diffusion imaging analysis.
* 2005: (with Ansgar Furst) delivered 4 day SPM course in Oslo.
