      <td width="100%"><b>Objective:</b>  FMRI data suffer from considerable movement-related variance, even<br>
after spatial realignment has been applied.  This variance will cause<br>
loss of statistical power, and may cause bias if movement is related to<br>
the experimental paradigm.  One approach to adjusting for these<br>
effects is to add some function of the estimated movement parameters<br>
(MPs) as covariates to the statistical analysis.  There is limited<br>
evidence from real data as to what function of MPs to use.  Here I<br>
report the results of applying different functions of MPs to a typical<br>
dataset.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Methods:</b>  	<br>
The analysis used data from a visual event-related design reported<br>
previously (ref 1).  The visual events produced reliable activation in<br>
visual cortex.  There were 11 subjects, 7 scan runs per subject, 126<br>
scans per run, TR 2 seconds. Each scan run was analyzed using three<br>
different models: 1) simple model, no MPs; 2) MPs model, using 6 MPs<br>
only (translations, rotations); 3) spin-history model (ref 2) - MPs,<br>
MPs squared (MP2), MPs offset by one scan (MP+1), MP2 offset by one<br>
(MP2+1) - giving 24 design columns.  Each model also included 2 event<br>
regressors (ERs) - the event onsets convolved with a standard<br>
haemodynamic response and its temporal derivative.  I used F tests to<br>
assess variance explained by a) ERs b) MPs c) MP2 d) MP+1 e) MP2+1.<br>
To restrict focus to an area of activation, for each model and each<br>
each subject, one run was selected to define a visual ROI using the F<br>
test for the ERs.  This run was not used for further analysis.  The<br>
statistics below are for the mean signal from this ROI, for the<br>
remaining runs.<br>
<br>
<br><b>Results &amp; Discussion:</b>  	<br>
The median F statistic within the visual cortex ROI, for the simple<br>
model, MP model and spin-history model were 26.4, 38.0 and 33.8<br>
respectively.  The median F statistic for the MPs was 6.4 and 4.5 for<br>
the MPs and spin-history model, which were significant (p &lt; 0.05) in<br>
88% and 79% of the analyses respectively.  The remaining F values (%<br>
significant) for the spin history model were 1.7 (55), 1.4 (27) and 1.3<br>
(21) for MP2, MP+1 and MP2+1 respectively. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Conclusions:</b>  										<br>
The fact that the F value increased when adding the movement<br>
parameters to the simple model suggests that, for this dataset, the<br>
movement parameters were useful in increasing signal to noise.  Adding<br>
simple movement parameters as covariates to the statistical model is<br>
likely to be a useful default for analysing FMRI data.  The use of<br>
further functions of movement parameters is less convincing in this<br>
dataest.	<br><b>References &amp; Acknowledgements:</b>  																						<br>
