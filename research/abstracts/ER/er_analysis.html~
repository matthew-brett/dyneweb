<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Event related (ER) designs have become standard in recent FMRI
studies. Although they have major benefits in terms of the range of
phenomena that can be studied, they can be complicated to analyze and
interpret. Recent theoretical studies have addressed power in ER
studies, and have suggested that frequent events with random
inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) give high power. However, these
simulations have required several assumptions, including independence
between events. Therefore we have attempted to replicate the results
of these simulations in a real FMRI study.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>6 Subjects were scanned on a 3T Bruker scanner at the Wolfson Brain
Imaging Centre in Cambridge, using a standard EPI protocol, collecting
16 slices with a 2 second TR. Events were flashes of a visual
checkerboard lasting 0.5 sec, to which the subject had to respond with
a button press with the right hand. ISIs were generated from an
exponential distribution with a minimum of 0.6 sec, and means of 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 seconds, to give 7 different stimulus sets. Subjects
were scanned in each of the 7 ISI conditions, for 280 seconds per
session. The order of the ISI conditions was randomized across
subjects. We used SPM99 to correct the images for slice time offset,
realign to the first image in the series, and smooth to 8mm FWHM. In
order to identify the visual cortex we performed a standard SPM
analysis of the mean ISI=3 session (60s high pass filter, haemodynamic
response function (HRF) low-pass filter). We used HRF and temporal
derivative (TD) convolution for event modeling, and an F test on both
parameters to test for task effects. From this analysis we selected
the maximum activated cluster in the occipital cortex with voxels at
p&lt;0.0001 uncorrected. The region thus identified was used to
extract mean time courses in the other ISI sessions. We analyzed these
time courses with a similar model, but without low-pass filtering,
using the MarsBar SPM toolbox.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>To study the effect of different ISIs, we analyzed the model
parameters for the HRF and TD regressors. We also calculated the F
statistic for the two regressors, the t statistic for the HRF only, and
the root mean squared residual error (RMSE). There was a significant
linear trend for the estimated HRF parameter to increase with longer
ISI, reflecting apparent greater effect size with longer ISI
(p&lt;0.001); the effect size for ISI=1 was 60% of that for effect size
of ISI=10. The parameter for the temporal derivative showed a complex
effect of ISI (p&lt;0.05), which was mainly quadratic, with higher
values for intermediate ISIs. As for the simulations, there was a trend
for F and t statistics to decrease linearly with increasing ISI. The
RMSE increased linearly with increasing ISI.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>These results suggest that very short ISIs do result in an increase
in detection power, but with a reduction in measured effect
size. Error appears to increase with longer ISI. We will discuss the
implications of these results for the design and analysis of ER
FMRI.</p>
