<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The role of the lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) in man
is still not clear. Some results from monkey and human studies have suggested
that the LPMC is important when action selection is conditional on abstract
cues from the environment. Passingham has shown that monkeys with LPMC
lesions are unable to retain or relearn a task which requires them to perform
one of two movements on a lever depending on a nearby colour cue, and there
is some evidence for this effect in human subjects with focal strokes .
However, when the same task is made less abstract by placing the colour
cue on the lever itself, LPMC lesions do not impair relearning. We hypothesised
that these observations might explain why some patients with apraxia have
particular difficulty in such abstract tasks as miming a gesture to command,
but find imitation easier. We therefore designed a study to replicate the
observations in Passingham's monkeys, using normal subjects and PET.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Subjects and methods</FONT></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our subjects were 9 normal right handed volunteers aged
37-57 (4 male, 5 female). Before scanning they were trained for 90 minutes
on two tasks: simple imitation (SI) and abstract conditional (AC). Both
involved performing a series of four novel gestures with the right hand,
but differed in the mode of selection of which gesture to perform. In SI,
subjects saw a series of video clips of one of the four gestures, and imitated
the video. After each video they saw one of four abstract designs, which
they ignored. For AC, they saw a series of the four abstract designs, and
learnt to perform one of the gestures for each of the designs. After each
design they saw a video clip of the correct gesture, which they ignored.
Every subject learned the association very well with no errors after training.
They were then scanned, with 5 scans performing SI, 5 scans AC, and 2 scans
rest, where they watched the same series of designs / videos, but without
performance. Scan order was randomised. We used a bolus injection technique
with O<SUP>15</SUP> labelled H<SUB>2</SUB>0 in a CTI 953B PET scanner.
Scans were realigned with SPM96, normalised to the Talairach template with
SPM95, then smoothed to 16mm. Statistical analysis used standard settings
in SPM96.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The figures show voxels activated when compared to rest
in the SI and AC conditions. The two subtractions are very similar. There
was no activation of the premotor cortex at any threshold by either task.
Areas activated were SMA, thalamus, left motor, sensory and superior parietal
cortex, and secondary visual areas. Right motor, sensory and parietal cortex
were activated, but with lower levels of significance. Direct subtraction
of SI from AC showed no voxels surviving an uncorrected threshold of p&lt;0.001,
and no voxels in SMA or LPMC at any threshold.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Conclusions</FONT></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This experiment attempted to replicate studies in monkeys
and in patients suggesting that conditional action selection tasks depend
on the LPMC. In particular we speculated that the LPMC would be more active
during an abstract selection task. There was however no hint that the LPMC
was activated in either the abstract or imitation task compared to rest.
We suggest that these results are correct in showing that the LPMC is not
much involved in these tasks late in learning. The LPMC should not be seen
as performing one particular function in action selection, but rather as
a key area in the design of movement and learning of cue to action associations.</FONT>
