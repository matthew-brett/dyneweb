<P><B>Abstract</B> <BR>
  There are many situations where it may be important to align a structural image 
  of a damaged brain to that of a standard brain. For example, it may be easier 
  to appreciate the site of a lesion in relation to other brain structures after 
  such an alignment, and easier to compare the position of a lesion to a similar 
  lesion in another patient. There may be functional data that is registered to 
  a structural image, and we may want to compare the distribution of the functional 
  data across patients, or between patients and controls. 
<P>Unfortunately, the abnormalities in such images can make it dangerous
to use standard automated image coregistration techniques. This is because
most automated techniques attempt to minimize some cost function, calculated
across the whole brain, that reflects the amount of difference between
the image to be coregistered (the object image) and the image to register
to (the template image). Lesions usually have different signal intensity
from normal brain, and this results in a large contribution to apparent
image difference, even when the object and template image are well matched
outside the area of the lesion. In such cases, the minimization algorithm
may estimate inappropriate transformations, in order to register the lesion
area to normal brain.
<P>Affine coregistration is relatively robust to such influence, because
affine transforms that minimize lesion / template difference are usually
constrained by the effects of the transformation in increasing the image
mismatch (cost function) across the rest of the brain. In contrast, nonlinear
transformations may have very local effects, and these transformations
may be strongly influenced by the presence of a lesion. For these reasons,
studies that have used automated image registration of damaged brains have
usually used affine only coregistration. A solution to this problem is
to mask out the cost function in the area of the lesion. In this case,
matches of the lesion to the template no longer influence the minimization
algorithm, and the coregistration only attempts to minimize object / template
difference outside the lesioned area.
<P>Such a technique is implemented in SPM99. Cost function masking is by
a binary image, in the same space as the object image, with ones in areas
outside the lesion, and zeros within. The researcher must create this image
using an image editing program such as Analyze (1) or MRIcro (2).
<P>In order to validate this technique, we compared affine plus nonlinear
coregistration (normalization) using cost function masking, to the current
standard, which is affine only normalization. We selected 10 T1 weighted
MRI images of lesioned brains to normalize using both techniques. We selected
the images for unilateral lesions with a variety of pathologies; these
included anterior and posterior infarcts, an aneurysm clip, unilateral
temporal lobe atrophy, metastatic tumour and a patient with multiple areas
of cortical dysplasia. For each image we first identified the anterior
commisure, and then roughly aligned the images to the template by hand.
We then created the binary mask defining the lesioned area, using Analyze
AVW, and extended the lesioned area by 8mm in all directions to allow for
the effect of smoothing during normalization. The images were thence normalized,
once with affine parameters only, and once with affine and nonlinear parameters,
using the cost function mask. All normalizations gave a reasonable match
to the the template, with no obvious distortion of the lesioned area. However
the cost function masking gave a considerably better fit of the interior
brain detail such as the ventricular boundaries and the corpus callosum.
<P>To show those regions that differed from the template in the two sets
of normalizations we calculated an template variance image. For each voxel,
this showed the mean (across the 10 normalization images) of the squared
difference between the images and the template. The figure shows these
variance images; the top row shows the affine only template variance, and
the bottom the variance for affine + nonlinear with cost function masking.
The white areas around the corpus callosum and lateral ventricles reflect
areas of large avaerage mismatch between the template and the normalized
images; this mismatch is less for the cost function masking than the affine
only images.

<P>Cost function masking provides a principled and effective method of
using automated whole brain registration to coregister damaged brains to
an undamaged standard template. We suggest this technique is more effective
than affine only registration, and more objective and reproducible than
manual registration techniques.
