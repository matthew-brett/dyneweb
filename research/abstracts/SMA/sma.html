<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The roles of the premotor areas in the selection of action
are still controversial. One influential theory is that of Passingham .
He proposed that the lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) has a specific role
in ‘externally generated’ movement, whereas the supplementary motor area
(SMA) is more involved in action that is ‘internally generated’. Action
generation is external if the choice of action is conditional on some external
sensory cue, and internal if the choice of action is not dictated by an
external stimulus. An early PET study of paced joystick movements gave
only qualified support . It found that LPMC did not activate specifically
when the direction of movement was conditional on a colour cue, but SMA
was more activated than other premotor areas during random movements. This
result was confounded by the fact that subjects could prepare responses
in the random condition. We therefore designed a PET study that is not
confounded by motor preparation in order to test Passingham’s hypothesis.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Subjects and methods</FONT></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our subjects were 8 normal right handed volunteers aged
35-58 (6 male, 2 female). We trained the subjects for 45 minutes on two
tasks. In the <U>random</U> [R] task they heard one of four musical tones;
each of these tones cued them to press at random one of the four buttons
under the fingers of their right hand. Tones were spaced at random between
4 - 6 seconds apart. In the <U>conditional</U> [C] task they heard one
of four further tones. Each tone was associated with one of the four buttons,
and they had to press the correct button. After 45 minutes, they began
45 more minutes of trials where the R and C sounds were intermixed randomly
so they could not predict which they would hear next. During the scanning
session they continued to practice on such a mixture of tones. As each
scan began, the mixture changed to specific proportions of R and C, and
reverted to an equal mixture after 45 seconds. Each subject had 12 scans:
2 rest (tones but no response); 2 in which there were all R tones during
the first 45 seconds; 2 with all C tones, and 6 with varying mixtures of
R and C. None of the subjects were aware that the mixtures had been changed
during the scans. We used the bolus injection technique with O<SUP>15</SUP>
labelled H<SUB>2</SUB>0 in a CTI 953B PET scanner. Scans were realigned,
normalised and smoothed using standard settings in the SPM 95 software
package.</FONT>

uncorrected threshold of p&lt;0.001; Left = posterior</FONT></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The figures are from SPM 95, and show voxels with significant
activation compared to rest in the All R (fig. 1), and All C (fig. 2) conditions.
Areas activated are left motor and sensory cortices, bilateral parietal
cortices, left thalamus and a right ventral premotor / prefrontal area.
The two conditions show a very similar pattern of activation. In neither
comparison was there activation of SMA at any threshold. Comparison of
All-R and All-C showed greater activation in the right premotor / prefrontal
area for the All-R condition.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Conclusions</FONT></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our study was intended to test the hypothesis that the
SMA has a specific role in internal action selection. We believe our design
has removed the effect of motor preparation that confounded previous studies;
subjects could not prepare how to respond or when to respond. Our results
show no evidence for a specific role of the SMA in either mode of movement
selection. Previous findings of SMA activation during random movement may
be explained by the increased motor preparation such tasks allow. Once
this confound has been removed, the distinction between internal and external
action selection may not be of fundamental importance in explaining PET
activation.</FONT>
