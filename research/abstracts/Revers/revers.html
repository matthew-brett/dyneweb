<p>Humans are able to learn and select responses to sensory inputs according to 
  arbitrary rules. Previous studies show that specific visuomotor learning-related 
  activity is found over a distributed cortical network, centered on a prefrontal-temporoparietal 
  circuit. This study investigates the changes occurring with practice of stimulus-response 
  (S-R) mappings, isolating specific learning-related changes in the basal ganglia, 
  SMA and parietal lobes. Subjects performed an S-R mapping task for eight days. 
  They learned to respond with four button presses to four abstract shapes. The 
  task was practiced daily for 30 minutes. We studied brain activation during 
  this task using functional MRI on the first and last day. At the end of each 
  scanning session subjects also performed a reversed version of the practiced 
  S-R task, so that stimuli previously signaling a right response now indicated 
  a left response. In addition to the S-R learning tasks, we gave subjects a localizer 
  task, where they pressed right or left buttons according to the direction of 
  an arrow on the screen. fMRI data from the localizer task allowed us to identify 
  motor regions of each subject individually, and perform a region of interest 
  analysis on the data from the S-R learning experiment. We collected whole-brain 
  fMRI data on a 3T Bruker scanner. Analyses in individual subjects show changes 
  in activation over learning and reversal in the basal ganglia, SMA and parietal 
  cortex</p>
