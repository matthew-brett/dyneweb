<P><BR><E3>Abstract</E3><BR>Most
studies in functional imaging present the position of activations in
terms of Brodmann cytoarchitectonic areas (BAs).  The allocation of
activations to BAs often uses the Talairach 1988 atlas.  This
allocation is beset by uncertainties; for example, outside primary
sensory and motor areas, we have little data on the ability of
different normalization techniques to overlay cytoarchitectonic areas
across individuals.  The atlas itself presents problems; the brain
used in the atlas (the &quot;Talairach brain&quot; - TB) did not have
cytoarchitectonic analysis, so that the BA labels had to be estimated
by eye by comparing the TB surface with Brodmann's published data;
despite this caveat, Talairach remains the de facto standard for
estimating BAs.  <br><br>The problems enumerated above require
considerable research to address.  One problem that could be addressed
relatively simply is the difference between the TB and the brain
templates created by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI).  Many
studies, including most performed using SPM software, normalize to a
template based on those of the MNI.  Although these templates differ
from the TB, it is common to interpret coordinates from the MNI brain
using the Talairach atlas.<br><br>The TB was a post mortem specimen,
and has been aligned to the Talairach system, with the anterior and
posterior commisure on the same axial plane.  The MNI template is
based on an average of a number of normal MRI scans, which have been
linearly aligned to a common orientation, which is similar but not
identical to that of Talairach. The MNI template represents an average
brain, and is larger than the TB.  The difference in size is most
marked for the temporal lobes, where the differences are of the order
of 1cm (see left panel of figure).<br><br><br><table border=0

create a transformation to apply to the coordinates from the MNI
brain, to give matching coordinates in the TB.  There is no MRI scan
for the TB, but we created a brain outline for the TB, using data from
the Talairach daemon
(http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/talairachdaemon.html). For every
voxel in the MNI brain, we queried the daemon for the tissue type and
BA for the same voxel in the TB.  By using all voxels with tissue type
labelled gray or white, or labelled as brain stem / cerebellum, we
created a binary brain outline matching the shape of the TB.  We then
used SPM99 to normalize the binary brain outline of the TB to a binary
brain outline of the MNI brain (see right of figure). The brain
outline is closer to that of the MNI brain, notably in the inferior
temporal lobes. Maximum length in the axial plane for the MNI brain is
180mm, as for the transformed TB; the TB untransformed measures
174mm. <br><br>The transformation parameters from this normalization
allow us to a) convert between MNI and TB coordinates in an objective
and automated way, and b) reslice BA definitions from the TB to create
BA regions of interest in the space of the MNI brain.<br><p></P>
