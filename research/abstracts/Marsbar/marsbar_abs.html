<p><b>Abstract</b> <br>
  Most functional imaging studies use analyses that look for effects anywhere 
  in the brain. The standard approach is to calculate a statistic relating the 
  experimental effect of interest to the data for each brain voxel. This method 
  has the advantage that it can detect strong effects without apriori constraint 
  on the area that activation will occur. Problems arise when we wish to ask the 
  question whether a particular brain area has been activated: if we know the 
  shape and location of the expected activity, then voxel by voxel approaches 
  have low power, because of the multiple comparisons across voxels. Whole brain 
  analyses usually use image smoothing in order to increase signal to noise; however, 
  the best smoothing filter will depend on the shape of the activation, which 
  may well not be matched by a standard kernel such as a Gaussian. 
<p>The most direct answer to the question "has this area been activated"
is to use a region of interest analysis. Here we define a region, and perform
the statistical test on the mean time course of the voxels within the region.
The contribution of the voxels may be weighted using the expected shape
of the activation. This approach has two advantages. First, we increase
power by avoiding the multiple comparison problem. Second, if we are correct
about the shape and location of the region, the process of taking the mean
is equivalent to using the best smoothing kernel to recover the signal.
<p>This method has proved very powerful in analysing the activation in
well defined regions. For example, Kanwisher et al have used screening
tasks and voxel by voxel statistics to define regions of interest, and
used these regions to investigate the nature of the original activation
in further experiments of visual analysis of faces, scenes, objects and
body parts.
<p>We have implemented a toolbox called "MarsBar" for region of interest
analysis within the SPM99 software package (available for free download
from http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/marsbar.html). The user can define
regions using activations from previous SPM analyses, binary or weighted
images, or simple shapes (boxes or spheres). Regions can be combined using
a full range of algebra to give new regions. Functions include overlap
between regions (logical and) or combination (logical or). The software
can then extract raw or filtered time courses from the region for futher
analysis outside SPM. It can also use new or previous SPM analysis files
to analyze the regional time course. t or F statistics for multiple regions
can be computed, and the results plotted using the SPM graphical interface.
We are currently working on estimation of percentage signal change for
the region data.
<p>Region of interest analyses are likely to become more important as prior
hypotheses about the location of activation become more specific. This
may have many advantages in terms of statistical power and the ease of
interpretation of neuroimaging data. We hope that this toolbox will make
such analyses simpler to implement.
